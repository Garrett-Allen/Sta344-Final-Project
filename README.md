# Analyis of Literacy Rate in the Kerala region of India: A spatiotemporal analysis. 

This was my group's final project for Sta344: Intro to Spatiotemporal Modeling. In this project, we analyzed spatiotemporal data from the Kerala region of India, and modeled the relationship between school infrastructure, caste, income, and literacy rate among rural villages in Kerala. We ended up finding that, upon fitting a poisson non-spatial regression and a Intrisic CAR model to model literacy rate, none of the covariates present in our model predicted literacy rate well after accounting for spatiotemporal varation between regions. More details of our findings and methodology can be found in Final_Report.pdf, and our code can be found in Final_Report_Code.Rmd.
